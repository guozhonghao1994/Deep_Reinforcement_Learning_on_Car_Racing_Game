# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_on_Car_Racing_Game
## Task
Our project explores the algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) used in game playing. We study several RL algorithms and implement them in a car racing game. The RL methods include, but not limited to, DQN, Double DQN, and Dueling DQN. After the RL methods been implemented, we make comparison between these results and analyze the characteristics of each method.
